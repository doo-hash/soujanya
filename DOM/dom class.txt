=> dom is w3 standard which is platform and language nuetral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically acces and update the content, 
structure and style of the doc
=> with dom programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structire and modify or delete elements    anything
 found in a html or xml doc can be accessed, changed or deleted or added using dom
=> as a w3 standard one important objective of dom is to provide a standard programming interface that can be used in awide variety of environments 
and applications. 
dom can be used with any programming language.
dom can be seperated into 3 different levels
1. core DOM
2. XML DOM
3. HTML DOM

Core DOM.: this is the standard model for any structured doc.
XML DOM: standard model for XML doc.
HTML DOM: standard modal for HTML doc.

DOM defines objects and properties of all document elements and the methods to access them.

html dom: here all html elememts are treated as objects. it defines properties of all the html elements.defines methods to access all the html elements.
defines events for all the html elements.

simple html doc::
<html>
   <head>
      <title>html dom</title>
   </head>
  <body>
      <h1>gooooood</h1>
      <p>good</p>
  </body>
</html>

in the above image html is parent node and head and body child nodes of html node. title is the child node head. h1 is the first child of body. paragraph is 
 the last node of body.
